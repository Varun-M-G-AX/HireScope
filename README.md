## Overview

**HireScope** is an AI-driven platform designed to streamline the recruitment process by enabling HR teams to upload, parse, query, and search candidate rÃ©sumÃ©s at scale. The app leverages Streamlit for the user interface, ChromaDB as the vector database, OCR for PDF extraction, and OpenAI's GPT models for advanced rÃ©sumÃ© summarization and Q&A.

---

## Features

- **Upload RÃ©sumÃ©s:** Supports PDF uploads, robust text extraction (multi-library with OCR fallback).
- **RÃ©sumÃ© Parsing:** Extracts structured candidate data (contact info, skills, work history, education, etc.) into a unified schema using advanced AI prompts.
- **Semantic Search:** Instantly find top-matching candidates using ChromaDB vector search.
- **Chatbot Q&A:** Query candidate data in natural language with an interactive Streamlit chatbot powered by GPT-4o.
- **Modern UI:** Responsive, theme-aware design with enhanced UX and dark mode support.
- **Docker Support:** Easily deployable anywhere with a single Dockerfile.
- **Persistent Storage:** Stores resume embeddings and metadata for fast querying.

## How It Works

1. **Upload:** Drag and drop candidate rÃ©sumÃ©s (PDFs).
2. **Extraction:** Multi-method text extraction (PyMuPDF, pdfminer, pdfplumber, PyPDF2, Tesseract OCR).
3. **Parsing & Embedding:** Summarize and structure resumes using GPT-4o, then embed using OpenAI embeddings into ChromaDB.
4. **Search & Chat:** Use the chatbot or search UI to query the database for relevant candidates, skills, or experience.

## Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Varun-M-G-AX/HireScope.git
cd HireScope
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
> For full OCR support, you may need system packages: `tesseract-ocr`, `poppler-utils`, and their dependencies.

### 3. Set Environment Variables

- `OPENAI_API_KEY` (required): Your OpenAI API key for embedding and chat.
- `CHROMA_DB_DIR` (optional): Custom path for persistent ChromaDB storage.

### 4. Run the App

```bash
streamlit run src/HR_Chat_Bot.py
```

Or use Docker:

```bash
docker build -t hirescope .
docker run -p 8501:8501 -e OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-... hirescope
```

---

## Usage

- **Upload RÃ©sumÃ©s:** Use the upload page to add new candidates.
- **Search Candidates:** Use the profiles search page for semantic queries.
- **Chatbot:** Ask natural language questions about candidates (e.g., "Show me Python developers with 5+ years experience").

---

## AI Prompt Schema

RÃ©sumÃ© parsing follows a strict [schema](src/prompt_2.md) where all candidate fields (name, email, skills, work history, etc.) are extracted and normalized for reliable search and analysis.
